pCreate PIN using three given input numbers

"Secure Assets Private Ltd", a small company that deals with lockers has recently started manufacturing digital locks which can be locked and unlocked using PINS (passwords), You have been asked to work on the module that is expected to generate PINs using three input numbers.

Assumptions: The three given input numbers will always consist of three digits each ie, each of them will be in the

range >=100 and <-999

100 <= input1 <=999

100 <= input2 <=999

100 <= input3 <=999
Below are the rules for generating the PIN-

-The PIN should be made up of 4 digits

The unit (ones) position of the PIN should be the least of the units position of the three input numbers

The tens position of the PIN should be be the the least of of t the tens position of the three input numbers

The hundreds position the PIN should be the least of the hundreds position of the three input nÃ¼mbers

-The thousands position of the PIN should should be the maximum of all the digits in the three input numbers

Example 1-

input1129

Input2582

Input3 175

then. PIN 8122

Example 2-

input1 = 190

input2 = 267

input3 = 853

then, PIN9150

a=190
b=267
c=853
d=[] #ones
e=[] #tens
f=[] #thousz
d.append(a%10)
d.append(b%10)
d.append(c%10)
e.append((a//10)%10)
e.append((b//10)%10)
e.append((c//10)%10)
f.append(a//100)
f.append(b//100)
f.append(c//100)
o=[]
o.append(str(max(d+e+f)))
o.append(str(min(f)))
o.append(str(min(e)))
o.append(str(min(d)))
print(o)
print(''.join(o))
