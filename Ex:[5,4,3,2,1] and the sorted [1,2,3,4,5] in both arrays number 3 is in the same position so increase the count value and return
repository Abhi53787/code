given an array and check that sorted array and print the count of numbers whose position is same in original array and sorted array,
Ex:[5,4,3,2,1] and the sorted [1,2,3,4,5] in both arrays number 3 is in the same position so increase the count value and return 


l=[5,4,3,2,1]
a=sorted(l)
c=0
for i in range(len(l)):
    for j in range(len(a)):
        if l[i]==a[j] and i==j:
            c+=1
print(c)
